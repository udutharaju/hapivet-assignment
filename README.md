#  Veterinary Hospital Smart Appointment System
#  Team Name : RNA

# 1 .Problem Statement :
veterinary hospital appointment systems face several real-time challenges:

1.Overlapping appointments due to manual or inefficient slot management.

2.Sudden emergency cases disrupt the existing schedule and delay other consultations.

3.Doctor unavailability (sudden leave or emergencies) makes reassigning appointments complex.

4.Client no-shows waste valuable time and reduce hospital efficiency.

To address these issues, this project introduces an AI-powered system that integrates image and voice-based emergency detection.
It automatically detects emergency cases and reschedules appointments dynamically, ensuring better time management and faster patient care.
